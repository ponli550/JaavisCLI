I want to turn the following text into a Documentation Markdown file that a CLI tool named "Jaavis" can automatically harvest.

Please reformat the text using these rules:
1. The first line must be a Level 1 Header (# Title) representing the Skill Name.
2. The second section should be a concise 1-2 sentence paragraph describing what the skill does.
3. The third section should be a single Markdown code block (```) containing the primary code or configuration.

Text to convert:
